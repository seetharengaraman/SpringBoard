Ticket Sales Mini Project

Ticket systems are designed to support online ticket sales and purchase, for events like concerts and sports matches. They allow individuals to buy 
tickets directly through the platform.Many popular ticket platforms also manage ticket sales for third party resellers, by ingesting sales data from 
these vendors. 

In this project, a database is created in mysql called ticket_sales. Subsequently as part of the python code, a table called ticket_sale is created, 
with data inserted from CSV into the table. Once data is inserted, top three most popular tickets are listed.

Before executing, add the valid value for file_path_csv variable in main.py. This is where csv data is stored to be inserted into ticket_sale table.
Once this is added and saved, execute using:

python3 main.py

Sample results are stored in Output.txt file
requirements.txt hosts the dependencies to execute the python file
